# React Form Submission Demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a demo of a technique to send email from web form submissions from a web application without needing a backend server.

To see the accompanying blog post, visit https://sheelahb.com/blog/how-to-send-email-from-react-without-a-backend/. NOTE: this code has been migrated to use React functional components & hooks. If you'd like to instead view the previous implementation that uses React class components and `setState()`, see [this branch](https://github.com/sheelah/react-form-submission-demo/tree/use-class-components).

## Running the app

Install dependencies:
`npm i`

Start the dev server:
`npm start`

Overriding environment variables:
`REACT_APP_EMAILJS_USERID=foo npm start`
